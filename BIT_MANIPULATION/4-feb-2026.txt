Given 3 positives numbers a, b and c. Return the minimum flips required 
in some bits of a and b to make ( a OR b == c )
Flip operation consists of change any single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 
0 to 1 in their binary representation.

Example 1:
--------------------------------
Input: a = 2, b = 6, c = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: After flips a = 1 , b = 4 , c = 5 such that (a OR b == c)

Sample Input 1:
--------------------
2 6 5

Sample Output 1:
---------------------
3

Constraint:
------------------
1 <= a,b,c <= 10^9



2)Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the 
string and return it.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can 
appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

Sample Input-1:
---------------
hello

Sample Output-1:
----------------
holle

Sample Input-2:
----------------
Keshavmemorial

Sample Output-2:
----------------

Liam was a curious boy who loved playing with secret codes. 

One day, while flipping through an old book in his grandfather’s library, he found a strange note that read:
"To reveal the true form of a letter, flip its hidden switch!"

Liam scratched his head. What could it mean?
He decided to experiment. He took a small chalkboard and wrote down a few letters:
H e L l O W o R l D
He then noticed something interesting—each letter had a twin in a different case. 
Some were uppercase, some were lowercase. "What if I could magically switch them?" he wondered.

As he played with the letters, he discovered a fascinating trick. 
If he used a simple rule—flipping just the right part of a letter’s identity—he could swap between uppercase and lowercase instantly.

Excited by his discovery, Liam ran to his grandfather, who smiled and said, 
"Ah, you’ve uncovered the XOR trick! With a simple flip, letters can change their form."

Your Task:
Liam wants to automate his discovery. 
Can you help him write a program that takes a word and swaps the case of each letter using his newly found trick?

Input Format:
A single string containing uppercase and lowercase letters.

Output Format:
A string where each letter has been swapped to the opposite case.

Example 1:
Input =HeLLo WoRLd
Output= hEllO wOrlD
